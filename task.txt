Solve the Caesar Cipher problem.

As the user if they'd like to encrypt or decrypt the file.  Ask for the string key.  Ask for the input and output filename.

The encryption is solved by adding the numeric values of the key to the input .  
This may mean that the key needs to be repeated many times.  
The numeric values of the key can be calculated by determining the offset of the letter into the alphabet (a=0, b=1, c=2, etc).  
Please note, that the key will only contain letters, the input may contain other characters, but the key will only contain letters and it is NOT case sensitive.  
Upper case will always convert to upper case.  
Lower case will always convert to lower case.  
For example, "Hello world!" + "Password" ="Weddk nrglv!"
